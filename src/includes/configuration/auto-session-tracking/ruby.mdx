We create a session for every request and response cycle.

Web socket connections currently do not create sessions.

We mark the session as:

- `crashed` if an _unhandled error_ is raised.
- `an error` if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors).

By default, the Ruby SDK sends sessions. To disable sending sessions, set the `auto_session_tracking` flag to `False`:

```ruby
Sentry.init do |config|
  config.auto_session_tracking = false
end
```
