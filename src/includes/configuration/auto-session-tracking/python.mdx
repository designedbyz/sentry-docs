We create a session for every request and response cycle.
Web socket connections currently do not create sessions.

We mark the session as:

- `crashed` if an _unhandled error_ is raised.
- `an error` if the SDK captures an event that contains an exception (this includes manually captured errors).

By default, the Python SDK is sending sessions. To disable sending sessions, set the `auto_session_tracking` flag to `False`:

```python
sentry_sdk.init(
    auto_session_tracking=False,
)
```
